# Learning Clojure

## Rationale

I'm currently learning Clojure for fun and profit. This is to primarily document some of what I used to learn, in hopes that it might help others.
Most of the tutorials I'm doing are on branches on this repo, but some of them (e.g. Clojure Koans) are forked from another repo. All the repos/dirs that I've done are linked in their description.

## Working my way through these:

Check out the branches for the actual code.

- [x] [Clojurescript Up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025139.do)
  - I started knowing enough lisp that this wasn't hard. I figured it would give me a good overview of Clojure functions and js interop. Since I'm planning on professionally using cljs, I thought this would be a good place to start.
