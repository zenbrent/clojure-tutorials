# Om tutorial 2

Working my way through [this tutorial](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Intermediate-Tutorial).

I included the docs and config from [the free download](https://my.datomic.com/downloads/free), and am using homebrew's version of datomic.

To get started:
- `$ cd om-async`
- `rlwrap lein figwheel`
